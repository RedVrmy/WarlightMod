Allows players to make alliances with each other.  All alliances made are public -- to view them, open the diplomacy mod from the game's menu.

To propose an alliance, click Propose and select the player and number of turns to make the alliance for.  If they accept, both players will be unable to attack the other until it expires.

This mod was built via a manipulation of Fizzerâ€™s Diplomacy Mod.

Features:
- Disables any attack orders issued to a player controlled territory.
- To attack a player controlled territory, you must declare war through the Mod menu.
- Declarations are sent and all other players are notified by a UI alert the following turn.
